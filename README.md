# Methodology

Our analysis employs robust data cleaning, feature engineering, and a Random Forest Regressor model to predict summer daytime UHI. Visualizations are powered by Plotly, enabling interactive exploration of trends and relationships.

# AI Integration

The core of our AI integration lies in the UHI Predictor. This tool allows users to simulate "what-if" scenarios by adjusting key environmental and urban parameters, providing data-driven forecasts of UHI intensity. This helps in understanding the potential impact of various urban planning and mitigation strategies. New! This version also integrates GPT-4o to provide intelligent, context-aware mitigation advice for your predicted UHI scenarios, and offers a natural language interface to query the dataset. You'll also find AI-powered interpretations below most charts, helping you quickly grasp key insights.

# Data Source

The data for this dashboard is derived from the Census_UHI_US_Urbanized_recalculated dataset, focusing on various geographic, thermal, and vegetation-related features within U.S. urbanized areas.
